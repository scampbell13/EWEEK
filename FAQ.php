					<p>Q: I’m a guy, can I join POWE?</p>
					<p>A: Of course! POWE is interested in promoting women’s
						opportunities in engineering, but we’re more than happy to have
						males helping us in this (in fact we do have/have had guys on the
						committee)!</p>

					<p>Q: What are your activities?</p>
					<p>A: We put on a number of activities during the school year, some
