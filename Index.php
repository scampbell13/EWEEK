					<h1>Welcome!</h1>

					<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160The Faculty of Engineering is one of the
						constituent faculties of the McGill University in Montreal,
						Quebec, Canada, offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in
						chemical, civil, computer, software, electrical, mechanical,
						metals and materials, and mining engineering, as well as
						architecture and urban planning. The faculty also teaches courses
						in bio-resource engineering (Faculty of Agriculture) and in
						biomedical engineering (Faculty of Medicine) at the masters level.</p>

					<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160McGill University is a public research
						university located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The university
						bears the name of James McGill, a prominent Montreal merchant from
						Glasgow, Scotland and alumnus of Glasgow University, whose bequest
						formed the beginning of the university. Founded in 1821, McGill
						was chartered during the British colonial era, 46 years before the
						Canadian Confederation, making it one of the oldest universities
						in Canada.</p>

					<p>&#160&#160&#160&#160The Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS)
						is the coordinating body and voice of undergraduate students in
						the Faculty of Engineering. All students registered in the Faculty
						of Engineering automatically become members of the EUS. The EUS
						plays very active roles in enhancing all aspects of student life
						in the Faculty, including social events, sports, volunteerism,
						competitions and academics.</p>
